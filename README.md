**Theme**: "Another Direction"

TODO:
	


Game Ideas:
	
	Generate platforms in corners when gravity flips
		Platforms need to spawn within radius of another
		maybe have some "default" path that is much slower but always there
		Add platforms in areas that are too hard to reach
		
	Player movement:
		charging jump to reach further platforms

	Generate enemies:
		walking enemies
		shooting enemies
		sawblade type traps
		
		Robot/machine themed
		
	Generate currency
		used for upgrades, maybe distinct from other upgrades that you buy by pressing the button
		
	Boosts:
		rare, but very helpful
		jetpack
		teleporter
	
	Main goal is to press button certain number of times (or maybe as much as you can before time runs out?)
	
	Upgrades:
		
		press a button to pause game and open upgrade menu
		
		gravity flip timing
		player speed
		player jump height
		button press count (x2, x3, ...)
		# of coins generated
		# of platforms generated
		player health
		# of enemies generated
		chance of rare boost
		
	Theme: space ship destablized, you're trying to stabilize it by pressing the button
		OR: you're alien trying to destablize ship by attacking generator in center
